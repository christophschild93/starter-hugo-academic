abstract: Research into COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes are critical, but claims
  must be carefully evaluated to inform policy decisions. In a recent series of articles,
  Manning and Fink [1â€“3] use national-level data to describe associations between
  case-fatality ratios and male and female finger ratios (2D:4D), a suggested measure
  of prenatal androgen exposure, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) allele
  and genotype frequencies. The authors suggest that 2D:4D is linked with ACE variant
  prevalence, and that higher male 2D:4D is associated with higher case fatality ratios,
  and point to 2D:4D as a useful prognostic measure for COVID-19 susceptibility. A
  critical review and robust Bayesian analysis of the hypothesis is described here,
  finding no conclusive evidence of COVID-19 mortality and 2D:4D, nor associations
  between 2D:4D and ACE1 allele or ACE2 genotype frequency. This absence of evidence
  is present for data taken from the second wave of COVID-19 in October 2020. Problematic
  theoretical grounding, individual-level conclusions drawn from national-level data,
  and issues with statistical inference in the original articles are discussed. Taken
  together, the current data offer no clear utility of 2D:4D in determining COVID-19
  outcomes.
