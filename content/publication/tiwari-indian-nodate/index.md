abstract: Ingroup/outgroup categorisation is a repeatedly found phenomenon. Given
  the long-standing caste system, the Indian societal structure provides a unique
  perspective on such social categorisation. The Indian caste system contains hereditarily
  inherited identity roles defining profession and status-based hierarchies. In this
  preregistered experiment, we investigate the influence of caste-based identity on
  cooperation using a (hypothetical) Prisoner’s Dilemma. Specifically, Indian participants
  (N = 685) were paired with a (hypothetical) other in a Prisoner’s Dilemma, whose
  last name reflected either a general caste (i.e., a “high” caste) or a backward
  (“lower”) caste including the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, and other backward
  classes. Because participants indicated belonging to a general or a backward caste
  themselves, they thus played the (hypothetical) Prisoner’s Dilemma with either a
  member of the same or a different caste group. We did not find that the partner’s
  caste group membership in terms of stemming from an ingroup (same caste) or outgroup
  (different caste) influenced participants’ cooperation. Further, we found participants
  from the general caste to be more cooperative when paired with (hypothetical) backward
  caste others (outgroup), compared to backward caste participants when paired with
  (hypothetical) general caste participants (outgroup); however, this difference disappeared
  once controlling for other demographic characteristics.
