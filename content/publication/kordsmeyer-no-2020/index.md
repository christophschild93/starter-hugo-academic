abstract: ', Facial fluctuating asymmetry (FA), presumably a proxy measure of developmental
  instability, has been proposed to inversely relate to vocal attractiveness, which
  may convey information on heritable fitness benefits. Using an improved method of
  measuring facial FA, we sought to replicate two recent studies that showed an inverse
  correlation of facial FA with vocal attractiveness. In two samples of men (N = 165)
  and women (N = 157), we investigated the association of automatically measured facial
  FA based on 3D face scans with male and female observer-rated attractiveness of
  voice recordings. No significant associations were found for men or women, also
  when controlling for facial attractiveness, age, and body mass index. Equivalence
  tests show that effect sizes were significantly smaller than previous meta-analytic
  effects, providing robust evidence against a link of facial FA with vocal attractiveness.
  Thus, our study contradicts earlier findings that vocal attractiveness may signal
  genetic quality in humans via an association with FA.'
