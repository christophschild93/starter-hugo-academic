abstract: Research on links between peoples’ personality traits and their voices has
  primarily focused on other peoples’ personality judgments about a target person
  based on a target person’s vocal characteristics, particularly voice pitch. However,
  it remains unclear whether individual differences in voices are linked to actual
  individual differences in personality traits, and thus whether vocal characteristics
  are indeed valid cues to personality. Here, we investigate how the personality traits
  of the Five Factor Model of Personality, sociosexuality, and dominance are related
  to measured fundamental frequency (voice pitch) and formant frequencies (formant
  position). For this purpose, we conducted a secondary data analysis of a large sample
  (2217 participants) from eleven different, independent datasets with a Bayesian
  approach. Results suggest substantial negative relationships between voice pitch
  and self-reported sociosexuality, dominance and extraversion in men and women. Thus,
  personality might at least partly be expressed in people’s voice pitch. Evidence
  for an association between formant frequencies and self-reported personality traits
  is not compelling but remains uncertain. We discuss potential underlying biological
  mechanisms of our effects and suggest a number of implications for future research.
