abstract: Dishonest and fraudulent behavior poses a serious threat to both individuals
  and societies. Many studies investigating dishonesty rely on (one of) a few well-established
  lab and online cheating paradigms. Quite surprisingly, though, the external validity
  of these paradigms has only been investigated in a small number of studies, raising
  the question of whether behavior in these paradigms is related to real-life dishonesty
  or, more broadly, socially questionable behavior. Tackling this gap, we link observed
  behavior in two widely used cheating paradigms to approval rates on two crowdworking
  platforms (namely, Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk) using data from four studies
  (overall N = 5,183). Results indicate that lower approval rates are associated with
  higher proportions of dishonest individuals. Importantly, this relation also holds
  for crowdworkers who exceed commonly used thresholds for study inclusion. The results
  thus support the external validity of (two widely used) cheating paradigms. Further,
  the study identifies approval rates as a variable that explains dishonesty on crowdworking
  platforms.
