abstract: The question of whether and, if so, how creativity and unethical behavior
  such as dishonesty are related to each other has been addressed in multiple studies,
  with mixed results overall. The aim of this Registered Report is to shed further
  light on this issue. We first present a meta-analysis on the relation between creativity
  and dishonesty comprising the samples from a pre-registered multi-lab study (on
  a different topic), which found no relation between the constructs in question (k
  = 19, N = 2,154, rp = .02). Next, we examined the relation between creativity and
  dishonesty in a study (N = 1,152), in which we addressed several limitations of
  previous research. Specifically, we examined relations between comprehensively assessed
  creativity and dishonesty using subjective and objective indicators for both constructs.
  We found mixed results concerning the relation between creativity and dishonesty.
  In the majority of the confirmatory statistical tests, subjective creativity was
  positively related, whereas objective creativity was negatively related to dishonesty
  in the mind game. However, in exploratory analyses, we found that neither subjective
  nor objective creativity was relatetd to dishonesty in the second dishonesty measure,
  the sender-receiver game.
