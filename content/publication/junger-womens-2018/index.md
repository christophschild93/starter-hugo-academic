abstract: Are estrous mate preference shifts robust? This question is the subject
  of controversy within human evolutionary sciences. For nearly two decades, mate
  preference shifts across the ovulatory cycle were considered an important feature
  of human sexual selection, directing women's attention toward mates with indicators
  of “good genes” in their fertile phase, when conception is possible. However, several
  recent studies on masculine faces, bodies and behaviors did not find evidence supporting
  this account, known as the good genes ovulatory shift hypothesis. Furthermore, evidence
  that preferences for masculine characteristics in men's voices are related to women's
  cycle phase and hormonal status is still equivocal. Here, we report two independent
  within-subject studies from different labs with large sample sizes (N = 202 tested
  twice in Study 1; N = 157 tested four times in Study 2) investigating cycle shifts
  in women's preferences for masculine voices. In both studies, hormonal status was
  assessed directly using salivary assays of steroid hormones. We did not find evidence
  for effects of cycle phase, conception risk, or steroid hormone levels on women's
  preferences for masculine voices. Rather, our studies partially provide evidence
  for cycle shifts in women's general attraction to men's voices regardless of masculine
  characteristics. Women's relationship status and self-reported stress did not moderate
  these findings, and the hormonal pattern that influences these shifts remains somewhat
  unclear. We consider how future work can clarify the mechanisms underlying psychological
  changes across the ovulatory cycle.
