abstract: Abstract Previous research suggests that judgments about a male speaker's
  trustworthiness vary due to the speaker's voice pitch (mean F0) and differ across
  domains. However, mixed results in terms of the direction and extent of such effects
  have been reported. Moreover, no study so far has investigated whether men's mean
  F0 is, indeed, a valid cue to their self-reported and behavioral trustworthiness,
  and whether trustworthiness judgments are accurate. We tested the relation between
  mean F0 and actual general, economic, and mating-related trustworthiness in 181
  men, as well as trustworthiness judgments of 95 perceivers across all three domains.
  Analyses show that men's mean F0 is not related to Honestyâ€“Humility (as a trait
  indicator of general trustworthiness), trustworthy intentions, or trust game behavior,
  suggesting no relation of mean F0 to general or economic trustworthiness. In contrast,
  results suggest that mean F0 might be related to mating-related trustworthiness
  (as indicated by self-reported relationship infidelity). However, lower mean F0
  was judged as more trustworthy in economic but less trustworthy in mating-related
  domains and rather weakly related to judgments of general trustworthiness. Trustworthiness
  judgments were not accurate for general or economic trustworthiness, but exploratory
  analyses suggest that women might be able to accurately judge men's relationship
  infidelity based on their voice pitch. Next to these analyses, we report exploratory
  analyses involving and controlling for additional voice parameters.
