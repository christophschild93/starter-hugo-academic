abstract: 'Computerized versions of population inferred cheating tasks (C-PICT)—i.e.,
  tasks in which dishonesty is statistically determined on the aggregate by comparing
  self-reported outcomes with a known probability distribution—have become increasingly
  popular. To this date no study has investigated whether non-computerized population
  inferred cheating tasks (PICT) and C-PICT as well as different implementations of
  C-PICT produce similar results. The current study tackles both issues via a well-powered
  pre-registered online experiment (N = 3,645) with four conditions. Participants
  played either a non-computerized coin toss task (CTT) (C1) or one of three computerized
  CTT: a computerized CTT provided via an external website (C2), a computerized CTT
  provided within the survey framework of the study in which participants were explicitly
  informed that the actual outcome of the CTT was not monitored (C3), or a computerized
  CTT provided within the survey framework of the study in which participants were
  explicitly informed that the actual outcome of the CTT was monitored (C4). A priori
  we expected the probability of dishonesty to be higher in C1 compared to C2, C3,
  and C4, as well as lower in C4 compared to C3 and C2. Results show that the probability
  of dishonesty is higher in C1 and C2 compared to C3 and C4. Conversely, no significant
  difference was observed between C1 and C2, nor between C3 and C4. Taken together,
  our results indicate that C-PICT produce results similar to PICT when they are provided
  via an external website, but not when they are implemented within the survey framework
  of the study.'
