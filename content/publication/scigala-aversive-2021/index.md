abstract: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has strongly affected individuals
  and societies worldwide. In this review and meta-analysis, we investigated how aversive
  personality traits—i.e., relatively stable antisocial personality characteristics—related
  to how individuals perceived, evaluated, and responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Across 34 studies with overall 26,780 participants, we found that people with higher
  scores in aversive personality traits were less likely to perceive guidelines and
  restrictions to curb the spread of the virus as protective (p̂ = -.11), to engage
  in health behaviors related to COVID-19 (p̂ = -.16), and to engage in non-health
  related prosocial behavior related to COVID-19 (p̂ = -.14). We found no consistent
  relation between aversive personality and negative affect regarding the pandemic.
  The results thus indicate the importance of aversive personality traits in understanding
  individual differences with regard to COVID-19.
