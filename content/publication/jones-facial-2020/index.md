abstract: Research on social judgments of faces often investigates relationships between
  measures of face shape taken from images (facial metrics), and either perceptual
  ratings of the faces on various traits (e.g., attractiveness) or characteristics
  of the photographed individual (e.g., their health). A barrier to carrying out this
  research using large numbers of face images is the time it takes to manually position
  the landmarks from which these facial metrics are derived. Although research in
  face recognition has led to the development of algorithms that can automatically
  position landmarks on face images, the utility of such methods for deriving facial
  metrics commonly used in research on social judgments of faces has not yet been
  established. Thus, across two studies, we investigated the correlations between
  four facial metrics commonly used in social perception research (sexual dimorphism,
  distinctiveness, bilateral asymmetry, and facial width to height ratio) when measured
  from manually and automatically placed landmarks. In the first study, in two independent
  sets of open access face images, we found that facial metrics derived from manually
  and automatically placed landmarks were typically highly correlated, in both raw
  and Procrustes-fitted representations. In study two, we investigated the potential
  for automatic landmark placement to differ between White and East Asian faces. We
  found that two metrics, facial width to height ratio and sexual dimorphism, were
  better approximated by automatic landmarks in East Asian faces. However, this difference
  was small, and easily corrected with outlier detection. These data validate the
  use of automatically placed landmarks for calculating facial metrics to use in research
  on social judgments of faces, but we urge caution in their use. We also provide
  a tutorial for the automatic placement of landmarks on face images.
