abstract: ",  Whereas voice pitch is strongly linked to people's perceptions in contexts\
  \ of sexual selection, such as attractiveness and dominance, evidence that links\
  \ voice pitch to actual behaviour or the formidability of a speaker is sparse and\
  \ mixed. In this registered report, we investigated how male speakersâ€™ voice pitch\
  \ is linked to fighting success in a dataset comprising 135 (amateur) mixed martial\
  \ arts and 189 (amateur) boxing fights. Based on the assumption that voice pitch\
  \ is an honest signal of formidability, we expected lower voice pitch to be linked\
  \ to higher fighting success. The results indicated no significant relation between\
  \ a fighter's voice pitch, as directly measured before a fight, and successive fighting\
  \ success in both mixed martial arts fighters and boxers."
