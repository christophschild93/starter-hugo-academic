abstract: Sexual selection appears to have shaped the acoustic signals of diverse
  species, including humans. Deep, resonant vocalizations in particular may function
  in attracting mates and/or intimidating same-sex competitors. Evidence for these
  adaptive functions in human males derives predominantly from perception studies
  in which vocal acoustic parameters were manipulated using specialist software. This
  approach affords tight experimental control but provides little ecological validity,
  especially when the target acoustic parameters vary naturally with other parameters.
  Furthermore, such experimental studies provide no information about what acoustic
  variables indicate about the speaker—that is, why attention to vocal cues may be
  favored in intrasexual and intersexual contexts. Using voice recordings with high
  ecological validity from 160 male speakers and biomarkers of condition, including
  baseline cortisol and testosterone levels, body morphology and strength, we tested
  a series of pre-registered hypotheses relating to both perceptions and underlying
  condition of the speaker. We found negative curvilinear and negative linear relationships
  between male fundamental frequency (fo) and female perceptions of attractiveness
  and male perceptions of dominance. In addition, cortisol and testosterone negatively
  interacted in predicting fo, and strength and measures of body size negatively predicted
  formant frequencies (Pf). Meta-analyses of the present results and those from two
  previous samples confirmed that fonegatively predicted testosterone only among men
  with lower cortisol levels. This research offers empirical evidence of possible
  evolutionary functions for attention to men’s vocal characteristics in contexts
  of sexual selection.
