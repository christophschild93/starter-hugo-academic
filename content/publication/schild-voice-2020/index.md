abstract: When judging a male speakers’ likelihood to act sexually unfaithful in a
  committed relationship, listeners rely on the speakers’ voice pitch such that lower
  voice pitch is perceived as indicating being more unfaithful. In line with this
  finding, a recent study (Schild et al. Behavioral Ecology, 2020) provided first
  evidence that voice pitch might indeed be a valid cue to sexual infidelity in men.
  In this study, male speakers with lower voice pitch, as indicated by lower mean
  fundamental frequency (mean F0), were actually more likely to report having been
  sexually unfaithful in the past. Although these results fit the literature on vocal
  perceptions in contexts of sexual selection, the study was, as stated by the authors,
  underpowered. Further, the study solely focused on male speakers, which leaves it
  open whether these findings are also transferable to female speakers.
