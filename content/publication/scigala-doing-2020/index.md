abstract: 'Research on the relation between creativity and unethical behavior has
  provided inconclusive findings, thus far. Herein, we focus on a mechanism that has
  been suggested as underlying a positive relation between these constructs: an increased
  ability to generate unethical justifications (i.e., reasons for behaving unethically)
  of those with high levels of creativity. Specifically, we test if creativity is
  more strongly related to the generation of unethical than ethical justifications.
  In a vignette experiment (N = 907, N = 20,719 rated answers), we find that creativity
  is equally related to the quality and quantity of both ethical and unethical justifications.
  Additionally, Honesty-Humility is positively related to the quality of ethical,
  and negatively related to the quality and quantity of unethical justifications.'
